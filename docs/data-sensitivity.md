# Data Security

Since data is transfered to our server located in Michigan, a wide array of security measures are in force:

- All interactions with the server are secured with HTTPS.
- Input data is deleted from our servers as soon as it is no longer needed.
- We only store the number of samples and markers analyzed; we do not access your data in any way.
- All results are encrypted with a strong one-time password, ensuring that only you can access them.
- After imputation is complete, the data uploader has 7 days to retrieve the results using an encrypted connection.
- The complete source code is available in a [public Github repository](https://github.com/genepi/imputationserver2).

## Who has access?

To upload and download genotype data, users must register with a unique email address and a strong password. Each user can only download imputation results for samples they have uploaded themselves; other users of the Imputation Server will not have access to your data.

## What security or firewalls protect access?

A wide array of security measures are in force on the imputation servers:

- SSH access is restricted to system administrators only.
- Direct login via SSH is not permitted from the public Internet.
- The public-facing side of the servers is protected by the School of Public Healthâ€™s Checkpoint virtual firewall, which uses a default-deny policy for inbound traffic, allowing only explicitly permitted TCP ports.
- The School of Public Health employs NIDS technologies such as Snort and Peakflow for traffic analysis and threat detection on its network links.
- On the imputation server, updates are regularly applied by system administrators who monitor multiple zero-day security advisories. OSSEC HIDS is used for log analysis and anomaly detection, while Denyhosts is employed to prevent brute-force SSH login attacks.


## What encryption of the data is used while the data are present?

Imputation results are encrypted with a one-time password generated by the system. The password includes lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers, with a maximum of three duplicate characters.
